###### Steps
1. Entered the data ingestion method or component
2. Read the dataset as dataframe
3. Train test split initiated
4. Ingestion of the data iss completed
5. Read train and test data completed
6. Obtaining preprocessing object
7. Categorical columns: ['gender', 'race_ethnicity', 'parental_level_of_education', 'lunch', 'test_preparation_course']
8. Numerical columns: ['writing_score', 'reading_score']
9. Applying preprocessing object on training dataframe and testing dataframe.
10. Saved preprocessing object.
11. split training and test input data
12. Best found model on both training and testing dataset
